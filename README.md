# Description
Prototype that uses machine learning to attempt prediction of mobile phone subscriber downgrades/upgrades from usage patterns.

# Contents
- __prepare-data__: Synthetic datasets used for the prototype. Also contains Groovy code
that's used to clean and label the datasets.
- __train-model__: Machine learning model training using (primarily)
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) and, to a lesser extent,
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

See [here TODO]() for a full description of the prototype and its outcomes.
